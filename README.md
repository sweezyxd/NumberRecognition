# NumberRecognition
Just a simple number recognition script I've made out of boredom today.

# Requirements
In order for the script to run successfully on your machine, you'll need to have the following packages installed:


-NumPy: `pip install numpy` (for linux: `pip3 install numpy`)

-Pandas: `pip install pandas` (for linux: `pip3 instal pandas`)


Note: the script will probably not work on manchines with a python version lower than 3, concider updating ur python to 3.9 for better usage and overall experience.

# Usage
